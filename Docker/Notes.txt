The files in this directory are all docker-compose orchestration files
for different occasions.

In preparation to execute the command(s) you must start a terminal session
in the Docker path.
The easy way to achieve this is to right-click the Docker folder and request
a terminal session. This will automagically start the terminal session in
the Docker path.

The general command to activate such orchestration files is:
docker compose -f <file-name> up -d --remove-orphans

---

ex:
docker compose -f .\docker-compose-MSSQL.yml up -d --remove-orphans
